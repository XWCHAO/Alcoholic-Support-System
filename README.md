Summary: It's hard to find a fine doctor to cure the addition "disease" or device to detect the body or find effective medicine to cure it, since its symtoms are not so obvious than other diseases. Drug and alcohol rehab has blossomed into a $35 billion industry since decades ago, charging over 10,000 dollars per person.  
Celebrities love to go to the expensive Malibu places 8~9 times(non-hospital rehab residential treatment) perhaps because the hospital programs don't work. Cliffside Malibu guarantee that it makes alcoholics sober much faster. It costs 73,000 dollars a month, while Four Seasons costs 40,000 dollars.  
Upper-Middle classes may have the chances to cure themselves spending such amount of money, while poor ones only have to do the 12-step or die desperately.  
Majority of hospitals are for profits, and only county hospitals could be non-profit. Poor people are fucked by addictions.

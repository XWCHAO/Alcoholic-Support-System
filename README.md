[video]HBO documentary Risky Drinking(2016.12.19): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eofKFReO3zo  
Summary:  
One in four adults in the U.S. is a binge drinker. Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the alcohol consumed by adults in the U.S..   
Less than 20% of people with an alcohol use disorder receive treatment.  
Three FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for alcoholism acamprosate and naltrexone
(In alcohol treatment, there are relatively new drugs naltrexone (Revia) and acamprosate (Campral) that are said to help reduce cravings. -- from FORBES: Reinventing Rehab)  
About 80% of people with an alcohol use disorder will relapse within the first year of sobriety.  
It requires a long term solution.  
Although more men than women have an alcohol use disorder, the gap is narrowing.  
Blackouts are episodes of amnesia that disrupt the ability to form new memories while intoxicated. You forget how much you drank exactly.
Chronic alcohol abuse can cause an overall reduction in brain function and size.  
You can go to a counselor and receive cognitive behavioral therapy which helps you deal with stressors and builds resilience for situations that are going to tempt you to drink. There are some medications will help you along the way. The real issue is that your whole life has to change so an individual like this will probably have to be supervised for a long time to come by some family member or loved one or some group because alcohol is killing them.

[video]From Rehab to a Body Bag | Dying for Treatment: VICE Reports (2014.11.10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mggiD9OvRQQ  
Summary:  
It's hard to find a fine doctor to cure the addition "disease" or device to detect the body or find effective medicine to cure it, since its symptoms are not so obvious than other diseases. Drug and alcohol rehab has blossomed into a $35 billion industry since decades ago, charging over 10,000 dollars per person.  
Celebrities love to go to the expensive Malibu places 8~9 times(non-hospital rehab residential treatment) perhaps because the hospital programs don't work. Cliffside Malibu guarantee that it makes alcoholics sober much faster. It costs 73,000 dollars a month, while Four Seasons costs 40,000 dollars.  
Upper-Middle classes may have the chances to cure themselves spending such amount of money, while poor ones only have to do the 12-step or die desperately.  
Majority of hospitals are for profits, and only county hospitals could be non-profit. Poor people are fucked by addictions. Many recovery/ treatment center do kickbacks and don't treat patients well, even many patients died after their family paid a lot of money because the centers' negative acts.

But excessive intake triggers the body defending the alcohol. (time stamp: https://youtu.be/6A9KG4d3j9o?t=3m11s) Alcoholics would get shaky, sweaty, cold & dizzy, out of consciousness when they've not take alcohol for a little long time.
Medical test to reveal how much permanent invertible damage to a body alcohol has done.  
1, Alcohol inhibits skin's ability to repair, the alcoholic don't heal wounds well. Alcoholics usually don't eat well, which leads to malnutrition. [Avascular necrosis for bones.] The whole body would be decimated by alcohol.   
2, Organs absorbs poison(alcohol) 7/24. Pancreas suffers most, and is the main cause of pain when one eats. Its main function is to release enzymes into small intestine to dissolve food as it passes through the digestive system. But the pancreas got confused by the toxicity of alcohol and release enzymes into its own tissues, the organ starts to cannibalize itself causing extreme pain.
Alcoholism is not a individual disease, it's a family disease, it affect everyone in a family.

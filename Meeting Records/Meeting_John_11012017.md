1. Right now, everything is just **hypothesis**. Do not need to consider how to get customers or investers. We can **assume** we have customers, and begin to **imagine** and think about what can we do.  
2. Online pharmacy part: we make the order for patients **directly** when the doctor signed an prescription. Do not let customers to choose whether to buy drugs online.  
3. We will **disrupt** A.A., it is not our partner.  
4. Target customers: people who are **rich and can pay for our service**. (Not poor people!)
5. Doctors & therapists: doctors just give the prescriptions, while therapists monitor the patients later. We match both doctors and therapists with the patient.

[video]HBO documentary Risky Drinking(2016.12.19): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eofKFReO3zo  
Summary:  
One in four adults in the U.S. is a binge drinker. Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the alcohol consumed by adults in the U.S..   
Less than 20% of people with an alcohol use disorder receive treatment.  
Three FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for alcoholism acamprosate and naltrexone
(In alcohol treatment, there are relatively new drugs naltrexone (Revia) and acamprosate (Campral) that are said to help reduce cravings. -- from FORBES: Reinventing Rehab)  
About 80% of people with an alcohol use disorder will relapse within the first year of sobriety.  
It requires a long term solution.  
Although more men than women have an alcohol use disorder, the gap is narrowing.  
Blackouts are episodes of amnesia that disrupt the ability to form new memories while intoxicated. You forget how much you drank exactly.
Chronic alcohol abuse can cause an overall reduction in brain function and size.  
You can go to a counselor and receive cognitive behavioral therapy which helps you deal with stressors and builds resilience for situations that are going to tempt you to drink. There are some medications will help you along the way. The real issue is that your whole life has to change so an individual like this will probably have to be supervised for a long time to come by some family member or loved one or some group because alcohol is killing them.

Summary:  
Higher educated, upper income, more alcohol.  
Distribution:  
	[Income/Education]Greater economic resources + higher socio-economic = buy more, participate in more activities including ding our at restaurants, going on vacation or socializing with coworkers(drinking rate in working > non-working in US).  
	[Religiosity] Attending church weekly drink (47%) < attending church less drink(69%)  
	[Gender] Men drink (69%) > women(59%)  
	[Racial] non-Hispanic whites (69%) > nonwhites(52%)  
	[Age] most common among 30~49 years old.  
Patterns:  
	[Income/Education]Near half of higher-income/ more educated drink within the last 24 hours > less than one-third of non-college graduates and middle- or lower-income drinkers.
	[Moderation]BUT, data shows that upper-income drinkers mostly drink in moderation, but lower-income Americans tend to abstain completely, or to drink heavily.



[video]From Rehab to a Body Bag | Dying for Treatment: VICE Reports (2014.11.10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mggiD9OvRQQ  
Summary:  
It's hard to find a fine doctor to cure the addition "disease" or device to detect the body or find effective medicine to cure it, since its symptoms are not so obvious than other diseases. Drug and alcohol rehab has blossomed into a $35 billion industry since decades ago, charging over 10,000 dollars per person.  
Celebrities love to go to the expensive Malibu places 8~9 times(non-hospital rehab residential treatment) perhaps because the hospital programs don't work. Cliffside Malibu guarantee that it makes alcoholics sober much faster. It costs 73,000 dollars a month, while Four Seasons costs 40,000 dollars.  
Upper-Middle classes may have the chances to cure themselves spending such amount of money, while poor ones only have to do the 12-step or die desperately.  
Majority of hospitals are for profits, and only county hospitals could be non-profit. Poor people are fucked by addictions. Many recovery/ treatment center do kickbacks and don't treat patients well, even many patients died after their family paid a lot of money because the centers' negative acts.

[video]Alcoholism Documentary (A Very Good Real Example!) from National Geographic Channel(2015.05.05):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A9KG4d3j9o  
Summary:  
One in 17 Americans abuse alcohol.  
Alcohol rapidly (90s) enters the bloodstream and reaches the brain, increasing the firing rate of pleasure chemicals like [dopamine] and [endorphins], the effect that provides the high. But excessive intake triggers the body defending the alcohol. (time stamp: https://youtu.be/6A9KG4d3j9o?t=3m11s) Alcoholics would get shaky, sweaty, cold & dizzy, out of consciousness when they've not take alcohol for a little long time.
Medical test to reveal how much permanent invertible damage to a body alcohol has done.  
1, Alcohol inhibits skin's ability to repair, the alcoholic don't heal wounds well. Alcoholics usually don't eat well, which leads to malnutrition. [Avascular necrosis for bones.] The whole body would be decimated by alcohol.   
2, Organs absorbs poison(alcohol) 7/24. Pancreas suffers most, and is the main cause of pain when one eats. Its main function is to release enzymes into small intestine to dissolve food as it passes through the digestive system. But the pancreas got confused by the toxicity of alcohol and release enzymes into its own tissues, the organ starts to cannibalize itself causing extreme pain.
Alcoholism is not a individual disease, it's a family disease, it affect everyone in a family.

Alcoholic Treatment Disruption

The need: There are over 16M Americans with an alcohol disorder. Traditional treatment (i.e., Hospital visit, alcoholic therapy, rehab center, etc.) is often inconvenient, expensive, and may not suitable for people who want to remain anonymous but still want to get help. (i.e., The alcoholic patient dropout rate is 76% in hospital and rehab. The number one reason is privacy as these people do not want to be seen in a rehab center or alcoholic treatment hospital.)

The customer: Alcoholics who want to remain anonymous in their treatment.

The value proposal: Provide a private way via technology to match patients and doctors, professional health experts in a private, accessible, convenient. Instead of having to visit a clinic, the patients can work with a doctor, and therapist, over their mobile phone. It is much cheaper and more efficient making it attractive for health insurance to cover the cost of service.

The channel: Mobile phone conversation maximizes privacy and convenience, making it easier for patients who can remain anonymous to stay long enough for their treatment of alcohol disorder. A software app could connect everyone, regardless of location, to access medical treatment to help them quit drinking .

Market size: Alcoholics is the largest “untreated epidemic” in America, but it is also growing all over the world with hundreds of million people have alcohol disorder. (Note: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services define “alcoholic” as people who drink five or more drinks in a day and on a weekly basis.)

Partnership: The solution is to connect as many patients as possible to healthcare providers. The startup will partner with several hospitals and health plans for their treatment.

Revenue: The startup will take a percentage of the treatment costs (i.e., negotiate with the hospitals and health plans.) Our software will safeguard each patient’ s privacy so their company and others will never learn of their participation.

Product: The startup product consists of a web page where patients can enter personal data. Our software can match them with the best doctors and therapist for treatment (i.e., according to their health plans and insurance). Once the relationship is established and approved, all sessions will be conducted via our mobile app that is similar to the tradition “rehab clinic” but at the convenience of the patients. The treatment session can be done at any time, anyplace where doctors and therapists  can provide consulting and treatment over the private mobile phone. Prescribed medication can be delivered to their patients’ home or picked up at a local pharmacy.

The future step is to collect and analyze patients and treatment data to learn the best treatment possible among a large number of patients then share with doctors, therapists to improve their approach.

Milestone: 1) Create the product: web page and the mobile app. 2) solicit patients 3) Partnership with health providers 4) grow the customers and build more partnerships to provide more care on broader scale in many cities, the U.S. continent, then other countries.

Alcoholic Treatment Disruption

The need: There are over 16M Americans with an alcohol disorder. Traditional treatment (i.e., Hospital visit, alcoholic therapy, rehab center, etc.) is often inconvenient, expensive, and may not suitable for people who want to remain anonymous but still want to get help. (i.e., The alcoholic patient dropout rate is 76% in hospital and rehab. The number one reason is privacy as these people do not want to be seen in a rehab center or alcoholic treatment hospital.)

The customer: Alcoholics who want to remain anonymous in their treatment.

The value proposal: Provide a private way via technology to match patients and doctors, professional health experts in a private, accessible, convenient. Instead of having to visit a clinic, the patients can work with a doctor, and therapist, over their mobile phone. It is much cheaper and more efficient making it attractive for health insurance to cover the cost of service.

The channel: Mobile phone conversation maximizes privacy and convenience, making it easier for patients who can remain anonymous to stay long enough for their treatment of alcohol disorder. A software app could connect everyone, regardless of location, to access medical treatment to help them quit drinking .

Market size: Alcoholics is the largest “untreated epidemic” in America, but it is also growing all over the world with hundreds of million people have alcohol disorder. (Note: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services define “alcoholic” as people who drink five or more drinks in a day and on a weekly basis.)

Partnership: The solution is to connect as many patients as possible to healthcare providers. The startup will partner with several hospitals and health plans for their treatment.

Revenue: The startup will take a percentage of the treatment costs (i.e., negotiate with the hospitals and health plans.) Our software will safeguard each patient’ s privacy so their company and others will never learn of their participation.

Product: The startup product consists of a web page where patients can enter personal data. Our software can match them with the best doctors and therapist for treatment (i.e., according to their health plans and insurance). Once the relationship is established and approved, all sessions will be conducted via our mobile app that is similar to the tradition “rehab clinic” but at the convenience of the patients. The treatment session can be done at any time, anyplace where doctors and therapists  can provide consulting and treatment over the private mobile phone. Prescribed medication can be delivered to their patients’ home or picked up at a local pharmacy.

The future step is to collect and analyze patients and treatment data to learn the best treatment possible among a large number of patients then share with doctors, therapists to improve their approach.

Milestone: 1) Create the product: web page and the mobile app. 2) solicit patients 3) Partnership with health providers 4) grow the customers and build more partnerships to provide more care on broader scale in many cities, the U.S. continent, then other countries.

# Value Proposition:
- What bundle of products and services are we offering to each Customer Segment?
- The **startup product** consists of a web page where patients can enter personal data. Our software can match them with the best doctors and therapist for treatment (i.e., according to their health plans and insurance). Once the relationship is established and approved, all sessions will be conducted via our mobile app that is similar to the tradition “rehab clinic” but at the convenience of the patients. The treatment session can be done at any time, anyplace where doctors and therapists can provide consulting and treatment over the private mobile phone. Prescribed medication can be delivered to their patients’ home or picked up at a local pharmacy.  
The **future step** is to collect and analyze patients and treatment data to learn the best treatment possible among a large number of patients then share with doctors, therapists to improve their approach.    
**Milestone:** 1) Create the product: web page and the mobile app. 2) solicit patients 3) Partnership with health providers 4) grow the customers and build more partnerships to provide more care on broader scale in many cities, the U.S. continent, then other countries.

- Why customers are willing to pay for your product or service?
- We provide a **private, accessible, convenient** way to match patients and doctors, professional health experts. Instead of having to visit a clinic, the patients can work with a doctor, and therapist, over their mobile phone. It is much **cheaper** and more **efficient** making it **attractive for health insurance to cover** the cost of service. It is a brand new way for alcoholics to become sober.

- Can it solve a customer problem or satisfies a customer need?
- Yes. In the US, less than 20% of people with an alcohol use disorder receive treatment. As long as we make it anonymous, cheap, credible, convenient and sustainable, alcoholics who want to be sober again are willing to use it.



# Customer Segments:
**Who** are they and **why** would they buy?  
**Pains:** Customer problem or need    
**Gains:** Customer solution  
> Different customer segments are different targets for us, though they may have slight overlapping features. And we try to focus and cover the most important ones of them, maybe simultaneously by one product.

## Segment A  
- **[Who]** Alcoholics who want to remain anonymous in their treatment.  
- **[Why]** The alcoholic patient dropout rate is 76% in hospital and rehab. The number one reason is privacy as these people do not want to be seen in a rehab center or alcoholic treatment hospital. People who get alcoholism suffer a lot, and usually they don't want anyone else to find out these facts, especially celebrities, who are seriously concerned about their reputation. Celebrities' going to the hospital or rehab center for treatment could always be discovered by reporters or ordinary people, then it won't be secrets any more among the society, which is quite harmful to the treatment process because patients have got negative feelings about themselves and the treatment itself. Even not famous people who get alcoholism will not be pleased when anyone except his/ her parents is talking about his/ her passive life, which is an important cause of people dropping the alcoholism therapy.  
So, it is important to keep the whole cure process anonymous, even the doctors or therapists do not know exactly who the patients are. All the doctors or therapists care about are the information of the physical and psychological symptoms of the patients' body as well as their medical history.

## Segment B  
- **[Who]** Alcoholics who are not rich enough to see a good doctor or alcohol use disorder therapist.  
- **[Why]** Nowadays, Effective and valid treatments are usually expensive. Rich people are capable to explore different possibilities to regain new lives, but poor ones are not. Majority of hospitals are for profits, and only county hospitals could be non-profit. They cannot go to expensive profit-making hospitals or even go for non-hospital rehab residential treatment. An example is Cliffside Malibu, which guarantees the treatment works and costs over 73,000 dollars a month, while Four Seasons costs about 40,000 dollars. Celebrities go there for help maybe because it works better than going to the hospitals. Middle- or lower-income immoderate drinkers tend to abstain completely, or to drink heavily. When they get addicted to alcohol, their lives are ruined since they have no available money to ask a doctor for help or no insurance cover. (Of course there is still one way to go, the AA 12-step method)  
So, decreasing the cost of the therapy is necessary for poor alcoholic patients to afford it.  

## Segment C  
- **[Who]** Alcoholics who have no idea where to find a certificated therapist for their alcoholism.    
- **[Why]** Cases exist that people spend a lot of money on useless treatment provided by irresponsible rehab center. Poor people are fucked by addictions. Many recovery/ treatment center do kickbacks and don't treat patients well, even some of the patients died after their family paid a lot of money because the centers' negative acts.  
So, it would be promising for desperate patients or families to have a platform that connects the qualified doctors and them.

## Segment D  
- **[Who]** Alcoholics who cannot persist the rehab program.  
- **[Why]** About 80% of people with an alcohol use disorder will relapse within the first year of sobriety. It requires a long term solution rather than a short one. One of the reasons for high alcoholism therapy dropout rate is inconvenience. People who have a disease still need to work, especially when it is the early stage of alcoholism. In the meantime, alcoholics need to see the doctors or therapists several times in a month or even in a week because of the self-control malfunction. Alcoholic patients need to be supervised and reminded in some way. It takes patients large amount of time to commute from home to hospital. Since a course of treatment may last for months or longer, it becomes really difficult for patients to hold on to get sobriety eventually, especially for businessmen or entertainment celebrities, who are always in a busy condition or live in no fixed homes.  
So, it may become workable and sustainable when the treatment between patients and doctors could be processed nearly anywhere and anytime.

**Product**  
A web page or mobile app where patients can enter personal data, then match them with the best doctors and therapist for treatment (i.e., according to their health plans and insurance).  

### The reason why customers are willing to pay?
Our product can provide a way via technology to match patients and doctors, professional health experts in a private way. Instead of having to visit a clinic, the patients can work with a doctor, and therapist, over their mobile phone so it is more convenient compared to the traditional ways. It is much cheaper and more efficient making it attractive for health insurance to cover the cost of service.

### Solve a customer problem or satisfies a customer need
Treating alcohol disorder is in high demand because there are over 16M Americans with an alcohol disorder. Traditional treatment (i.e., Hospital visit, alcoholic therapy, rehab center, etc.) is often inconvenient, expensive, and may not suitable for people who want to remain anonymous but still want to get help. (i.e., The alcoholic patient dropout rate is 76% in hospital and rehab. The number one reason is privacy as these people do not want to be seen in a rehab center or alcoholic treatment hospital.)

### Innovative or similar to existing market offers but with added features

**What bundle of products and services are we offering to each Customer Segment?**
- The **startup product** consists of a web page where patients can enter personal data. Our software can match them with the best doctors and therapist for treatment (i.e., according to their health plans and insurance).

The treatment session can be done at any time, anyplace where doctors and therapists can provide consulting and treatment over the private mobile phone. Prescribed medication can be delivered to their patients’ home or picked up at a local pharmacy.  
The **future step** is to collect and analyze patients and treatment data to learn the best treatment possible among a large number of patients then share with doctors, therapists to improve their approach.    
**Milestone:** 1) Create the product: web page and the mobile app. 2) solicit patients 3) Partnership with health providers 4) grow the customers and build more partnerships to provide more care on broader scale in many cities, the U.S. continent, then other countries.

**Why customers are willing to pay for your product or service?**

It is much **cheaper** and more **efficient** making it **attractive for health insurance to cover** the cost of service. It is a brand new way for alcoholics to become sober.

**Can it solve a customer problem or satisfies a customer need?**
- Yes. In the US, less than 20% of people with an alcohol use disorder receive treatment. As long as we make it anonymous, cheap, credible, convenient and sustainable, alcoholics who want to be sober again are willing to use it.

### CUSTOMER’S PROBLEM
1. Alcohol Use Order:
Alcohol use disorder sometimes is considered as a disease which can be cured by patient’s willpower. Actually, alcohol use disorder is a brain disease, which doctors diagnose when a patient’s drinking causes distress or harm that has caused changes in your brain and make it pretty hard to quit.[1]

2. Privacy Issues:
Patients risk their health by keeping other medical providers in the dark about their substance abuse treatment. Or risk their jobs, homes and child-custody arrangements by potentially damaging treatment details to be electronically shared with an array of medical providers. The mere threat that treatment details might be disclosed can be enough to deter people from seeking help..[2]

3. Treatment Problem
The traditional ways to cure alcohol use order are behavioral treatments like counseling doctors, psychologists, using prescribed medications to combine with counseling, mutual- support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous(AA) where people self-organize a group to provide peer support [3]  

The first problem is, there exists some report that says AA is not useful, someone says it’s useful, we cannot conclude the positive influence made by AA.  

The second problem is, all of them require patients’ offline participation. For counseling part, it requires more time to wait and reserve an appointment with a doctor, for medications, patients also have to buy them outside. for mutual-support group, it’s not very flexible to organize a meeting or have conversation with other people

### Why people drink?
Alcohol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, so it slows down mental and bodily processes. With the first drink of alcohol, users may experience a decrease in feelings of anxiety or stress. It is commonly touted as a social lubricant, meaning drinkers are more likely to feel confidence in meeting new people and less concerned with how they are perceived by others.  

### How to identify alcoholics?
Since alcohol is legal and widely accepted in society, it can be hard to tell the difference between casual use and abuse. Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, but anyone whose life is negatively affected by alcohol on a consistent basis is considered to have an alcohol use disorder.  

### Current situation? (copy from John’s email)
There are over 16M Americans with an alcohol disorder. Traditional treatment (i.e., Hospital visit, alcoholic therapy, rehab center, etc.) is often inconvenient, expensive, and may not suitable for people who want to remain anonymous but still want to get help. (i.e., The alcoholic patient dropout rate is 76% in hospital and rehab. The number one reason is privacy as these people do not want to be seen in a rehab center or alcoholic treatment hospital.)  

### Current organizations for helping alcoholics? A.A.
A.A. is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 whose "primary purpose" is to help alcoholics "stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety" (via Wikipedia). The main method is to follow the 12 steps, which were created by the founders of A.A. to establish guidelines for the best way to overcome an addiction to alcohol. This program gained enough success in its early years.
(http://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/twelve-steps-of-alcoholics-anonymous)  

The 12 steps are mainly an inside treatment that depends on whether the patients are mentally depressed or not. It seems that as long as patients have a spiritual awakening, they can be controlled by themselves and stop drinking. Those theories are so deeply ingrained in the United States that many people believe attending meetings, earning one’s sobriety chips, and never taking another sip of alcohol is the only way to get better.
However, although few people seem to realize it, there are alternatives, including prescription drugs and therapies that aim to help patients learn to drink in moderation. Unlike Alcoholics Anonymous, these methods are based on modern science and have been proved, in randomized, controlled studies, to work.

### What can we do?
Our product guarantees the privacy of patients, since the whole treatment process is via mobile phone and Internet. Patients can describe their situations and the doctors can give advice all by simply texting and doctors can even send a scanned prescription picture for the patients to get drugs in pharmacy.
